# Web Scraping System v1

## Core Components
- [ ] Single-threaded scraper service
- [ ] Basic rate limiter
- [ ] Data normalizer
- [ ] Simple API endpoints

## Implementation

### 1. Basic Scraper
- [ ] Playwright-based scraper
  - Single instance
  - Sequential execution
  - Built-in retry logic
- [ ] Simple delay system (fixed delays)
- [ ] robots.txt compliance

### 2. Data Processing
- [ ] JSON storage (local/S3)
- [ ] Basic schema validation
  - Price
  - Location
  - Square footage
  - Bedrooms/bathrooms
- [ ] Simple deduplication (exact match)

### 3. Quality Control
- [ ] Basic data validation
  - Price range checks
  - Required fields
  - Format validation
- [ ] Error logging

### 4. Storage
- [ ] SQLite database (can upgrade to PostgreSQL later)
- [ ] Daily snapshots
- [ ] Basic cleanup job

## Target Sources (Pick 2-3 Initially)
- [ ] apartments.com
- [ ] zillow.com
- [ ] local property sites

## API Endpoints
- GET /markets/{city}/stats
- GET /markets/{city}/trends
- GET /health

## Best Practices
1. Rate Limiting
   - 1 request per 2 seconds
   - Respect robots.txt
   - Log all requests

2. Error Handling
   - Retry failed requests (max 3 attempts)
   - Log errors with context
   - Skip problematic listings

3. Data Quality
   - Validate all fields
   - Track source and timestamp
   - Flag suspicious data

## Monitoring
- Basic health checks
- Request logs
- Error reporting
- Daily collection stats

## Phase 1 Implementation Steps
1. Set up basic Playwright scraper
2. Implement single-source collection
3. Add data validation
4. Create SQLite storage
5. Build basic API
6. Add monitoring
7. Deploy single instance

## Technical Stack
- Playwright
- Express
- SQLite
- TypeScript
- Simple cron jobs

## Future Upgrade Paths
- Add more sources
- Implement proxy rotation
- Move to distributed system
- Add advanced analytics
